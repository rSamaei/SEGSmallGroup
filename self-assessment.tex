\section*{Objective}
Briefly outline the business objective of the system you have built.  Aim to identify what the system you developed aims to achieve (do not regurgitate the overall assignment).  This section should consist of a single paragraph.  Aim for less than 100 words.

%%% Insert your objective description here.
The objective of our system was to create a website where students and tutors could easily request and accept tutoring sessions. Our system hopes to achieve the ability to allow tutors to choose there proficient subjects and allow to submit requests. The admins would then be able to link tutors and students together if they have matching specifications. We also want to allow students to let the admins and tutors know they've paid as well as view there invoice. We wanted to include a clean and simple UI where admins can match tutors with students as well as allow them to view all scheduled sessions.

\section*{Features}
Identify the main features of your team's application.  Identify what type of user can access this (or their username), and any other constraints.  If necessary, describe how/where the feature should be accessed.  Small or very obvious features need not be included.  The examiners will be using this to assess and find the functionality available to users of the application.
