\section*{Submission checklist}
\begin{tabular}{|p{15mm}|p{13cm}|}
\hline
Check & Task \\
\hline
& The work that is submitted has been produced by members of the team only, without input from other students or third parties.  All use of examples from the internet and generative AI are declared in the README.md file.\\
\hline
& The team is familiar with the required deliverables for this project, outlined in the small group project handbook, available on KEATS.\\
\hline
& The team's shared GitHub repository has been registered on Team Feedback.  All commits are attributed to a member of the team.  The shared repository has a default branch that corresponds to the accepted version of the software.\\
\hline
& The version of the web application that the team wishes to submit has been deployed.  The deployed system is seeded with data that meets the requirements outlined in the specifications.  The system is accessible using the required access credentials.  All functionality has been tested.\\
\hline
& All team members listed above agree with the claims made in this checklist.\\

\section*{Objective}
Briefly outline the business objective of the system you have built.  Aim to identify what the system you developed aims to achieve (do not regurgitate the overall assignment).  This section should consist of a single paragraph.  Aim for less than 100 words.

%%% Insert your objective description here.

\section*{Features}
Identify the main features of your team's application.  Identify what type of user can access this (or their username), and any other constraints.  If necessary, describe how/where the feature should be accessed.  Small or very obvious features need not be included.  The examiners will be using this to assess and find the functionality available to users of the application.  

\begin{tabular}{|p{50mm}|p{40mm}|p{50mm}|}
